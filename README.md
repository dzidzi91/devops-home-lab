# DevOps Platform

DevOps Platform is a **local self-hosted DevOps environment** designed to demonstrate a complete DevOps lifecycle using modern tools and best practices.

The goal of this project is to implement and integrate the technologies and concepts recommended in the DevOps roadmap:

https://roadmap.sh/devops

The platform simulates a real-world DevOps environment including CI/CD pipelines, containerization, infrastructure as code, GitOps deployment, monitoring and logging.

---

# Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

* Practice the **full DevOps lifecycle**
* Integrate multiple DevOps tools into a single platform
* Build a **local self-hosted infrastructure**
* Demonstrate DevOps concepts used in real production environments
* Follow the DevOps roadmap step by step

This project is intended for **learning, experimentation and portfolio demonstration**.

# DevOps Lifecycle in this Project

This platform demonstrates the following DevOps workflow:

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. Jenkins pipeline is triggered
3. Application is built into a Docker image
4. Image is pushed to a container registry
5. Kubernetes deploys the application
6. Helm manages Kubernetes packages
7. Argo CD manages GitOps deployments
8. Prometheus collects metrics
9. Grafana visualizes system metrics
10. Loki aggregates logs from services

---

# Local Environment

The platform runs locally using:

* VirtualBox for virtualization
* Vagrant for infrastructure provisioning
* Docker for container runtime
* Kubernetes for orchestration

This setup simulates a **real production environment** inside a local machine.

---

# DevOps Concepts Demonstrated

This project demonstrates multiple DevOps concepts:

* Infrastructure as Code
* Configuration Management
* CI/CD Pipelines
* Containerization
* Container Orchestration
* GitOps Deployment
* Observability and Monitoring
* Log Aggregation
* Reverse Proxy and Networking

---

# Future Improvements

Possible future improvements include:

* Security scanning with Trivy
* Secrets management with Vault
* Service mesh with Istio
* Automated testing pipelines
* Advanced GitOps workflows
* Multi-node Kubernetes clusters
